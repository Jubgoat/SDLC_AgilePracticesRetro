# SDLC_AgilePracticesRetro
A retrospective on agile practices, the final for Software Development Lifecycle


How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  First I must understand what the problem is that the user has and take that to define it into what specifically the user needs.
This is where user stories come in to help, we take what the user needs and specify exactly what they need into a description 
based on the user's feedback. After this I would take those user stories and develop little by little building and getting feedback from the user
and then the cycle starts again. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    My answer would be similar to the last question, I would have to find out what exactly the user would need and then 
  define them into user stories. I would need to know what exactly the user wants and so I would need some sort of 
  statistics to show what similar programs' features that users seemed attracted to. We could also go about going directly
  to the user if that is a possibility for the product owner, so that a backlog may be developed with the most important first.
  I hope to take the ability to adapt at any given moment to a change in user demand and the clear lines of communication that
  comes with agile practices. I also like the organization of the Kanban boards, it helps to see the development process progress
  through a graphical representation. 
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  A good team member in software development would have the ability to listen to users and team members and have the ability to have
clear lines of communication with team members, scrum master, and product owner through meetings such as the 15 minutes stand-up meetings.
